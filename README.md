7) Responsive Design: The interface is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices, including desktops and mobile devices.

# Use Cases:

# How to Run:

1) Pull the Docker Image:

    docker pull filebrowser/filebrowser:latest

2) Run the Docker Container:

   docker run -d --name filebrowser \
  -v $(pwd)/my-files:/srv \
  -p 8080:80 \
  filebrowser/filebrowser

3) This command mounts the my-files directory on your local system to the /srv directory in the container.

4) Port 8080 on your local machine will be mapped to port 80 in the container, which means you can access the interface via http://localhost:8080.

File Browser is an excellent tool for anyone needing a simple and effective solution for file management via a web interface. Whether you need to manage personal files, collaborate with a team, or handle server-side file management, File Browser provides an intuitive platform to meet those needs. The easy Docker setup and interactive features make it a great choice for developers, admins, and casual users alike.
